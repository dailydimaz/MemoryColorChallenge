## 🛠️ Manual Building (Local Development)

If you want to build the APK locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (required by Capacitor CLI)
- Java JDK 17+
- Android SDK
- Android Studio (optional but recommended)

### Build Steps
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Build the web app
npm run build

# 3. Sync to Android project
npx cap sync android

# 4. Build APK (choose one)
# Debug version:
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release version:
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease

# 5. Find your APK
# Debug: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
# Release: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk
```

### Using Android Studio
```bash
# Open project in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# Then use Android Studio's Build menu:
# Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
```

- **Target SDK**: Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- **Permissions**: None (fully offline)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### APK Won't Install
- Ensure "Unknown Sources" is enabled
- Check if you have enough storage space
- Try redownloading the APK file

### App Crashes on Startup
- Make sure your device runs Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- Clear app data and restart
- Try the debug version instead of release

### Performance Issues
- Close other apps to free up RAM
- Restart your device
- Use the release APK for better performance

## 🚀 Publishing to Google Play Store

To publish this app to the Play Store:

1. **Sign the APK**:
   ```bash
   # Generate keystore (one-time setup)
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my-key-alias
   
   # Sign the APK
   jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA256withRSA -digestalg SHA-256 -keystore my-release-key.jks app-release-unsigned.apk my-key-alias
   ```

2. **Upload to Play Console**:
   - Create a developer account at [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
   - Create a new app listing
   - Upload the signed APK
   - Complete the store listing with screenshots and descriptions
