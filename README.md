# Memory Color Challenge üéØ

A brain-training memory game that tests your ability to remember and reproduce color sequences under time pressure. Built with modern web technologies and designed with accessibility and mobile-first principles.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Memory Color Challenge** is an interactive puzzle game featuring two distinct game modes designed to challenge different aspects of memory and reaction skills:

### üéØ **Game Modes**

#### **Levels Mode**
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with 4 colors on Level 1, increasing by 1 color each level
- **Fixed Secret Codes**: Each level has a unique shareable code (MEMO, PTRN, CLRS, etc.)
- **Time Pressure**: Complete patterns within decreasing time limits
- **20 Challenging Levels**: Unlock levels by completing sequences perfectly
- **Score System**: Earn points based on accuracy, speed, and level difficulty

#### **Challenge Mode (Rolling Sequence)**
- **Survival Gameplay**: Endless mode - survive as long as possible
- **Rolling Pattern**: Colors appear in continuous sequence with hidden elements
- **3-Second Timer**: Guess hidden colors within 3 seconds or face elimination
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Sequences grow longer as you survive
- **Survival Scoring**: Your score is measured in seconds survived

### üéÆ **How to Play**

1. **Watch**: Memorize the color sequence as it's displayed
2. **Remember**: Colors disappear and you must recall the pattern
3. **Reproduce**: Click GREEN and RED buttons in the exact same order
4. **Survive**: In Challenge mode, guess hidden colors before time runs out

## ‚ú® Features
